Hi! I'm Janneke, and I've just created my own website. There's not much here yet. Come back in the future to check out the progress!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(metathis)

meta() %>%
  meta_description("Janneke Hulsen: bioinformatician with experience in single-cell data analysis and immunology") %>%
  meta_name("github-repo" = "jannekehulsen.github.io/webprofile/") %>%
  meta_viewport() %>%
  meta_social(
    title = "Janneke Hulsen: bioinformatician with experience in single-cell data analysis and immunology",
    url = "https://jannekehulsen.github.io/webprofile/",
    image = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JannekeHulsen/webprofile/main/portrait.jpg",
    image_alt = "Photo of Janneke Hulsen",
    og_author = c("Janneke Hulsen"),
    twitter_card_type = "summary",
    twitter_creator = "@JannekeHulsen"
  )
```
